    # Welcome to the HashiConf infrastructure lifecycle management escape room.

    ## Escape the room by unlocking the lockbox with a 6-digit access code.

    - Each challenge in this track will give you the location of an object with two digits. For example, “Look under the desk.”
    - Each of these digits must be in order. They create a 6-digit code to unlock a lockbox.
    - You can write down each digit as you get them on the LCD drawing board provided.
    - If you get stuck, there is a 1-minute waiting period before you can ask the facilitator for a hint.
    - You have 8 minutes to escape the room.

    Before you get started, here is a tutorial challenge for you to get familiar with Instruqt.
